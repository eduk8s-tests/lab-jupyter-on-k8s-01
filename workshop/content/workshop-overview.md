Jupyter notebooks can be loosely described as being:

> an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

Jupyter notebooks can be deployed direct to Linux, macOS or Windows environments, or in containerised environments such as Docker and Kubernetes.

In this workshop we will investigate what is involved in deploying a Jupyter notebook to your own local computer system, as well as to Kubernetes.

The aim of the workshop is not so much as to provide a step by step guide, but to use the process as a way of evaluating whether deploying a Jupyter notebook application to Kubernetes even makes sense.

The issue here is that the typical user audience for Jupyter notebooks are people who aren't going to know anything about working with deployment systems such as Kubernetes. These people are definitely not operations staff, developers, or even power users. A system which isn't easy for them to use, isn't going to work out too well.
